Layers
======
A layer is a collection of geographical information that can be added to the map. 
Layers can be added to the map via the layers screen (:ref:`Menu <sec-menu>` > Layers).

The layers screen shows a list of available layers, an example is shown below:

   :height: 568px
   :width: 320px

   *The layers screen (Menu > Layers).*
   
Layers that have grey background are currently loaded on the map. If you tap an item without a grey background it will be loaded on the map and you will return to the main screen. If you tap a layer with a grey background it will be removed from the map. To remove all layers, tap 'More > Remove all from map' in the layers screen.

In the layers screen you can always access the :ref:`coordinate grid layers <sec-coordinate-grids>`. Optionally you can purchase a special layer, like the bicycle node network or the mountainbike routes layer.

It is also possible to import layers in wsf, kml/kmz, and geojson format.
