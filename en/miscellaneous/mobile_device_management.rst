Mobile device management
========================

If you are managing multiple devices via a mobile device management (MDM) system, you can automatically deploy Topo GPS for free on these devices using your MDM software.

The apps installed via MDM will initially not have access to any of the maps.

We can send you a MDM configuration xml, which contains a field for a secret license key that we can generate for you. 

We can set the accessible maps according to your wishes.

Your users running the managed Topo GPS app will automatically get access to the accessible maps.

If you contact us we can make a quotation for you and setup things according to your wishes.
Pricing is per device per map and the same as for normal customers. We only sell volumes of 50 licenses or more at a time.
If everything is working as it should we will send you an invoice. If more devices will be added in the future, additional licenses should be bought later.

If you are interested or if you need more information, you can contact us by e-mail (support@topo-gps.com).
