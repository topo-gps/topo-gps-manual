New device
==========

If you have obtained a new device, you can install Topo GPS for free from the AppStore or the Google Play store. Below we discuss the various possibilities.

Apple -> Apple
--------------
Purchases
~~~~~~~~~
The purchase are connected to your Apple account, so if you use the same Apple account on your new device the earlier purchases should remain accessible.
Sometimes it might be necessary to go to Menu > Maps > More maps and tap 'Restore previous` purchases to retrieve the earlier purchases.
If you have bought partial maps, you need to enable in the device settings under your Apple account > iCloud > Apps > Topo GPS on both your old and your new device.

Routes and points
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The easiest method of transfering the routes and points is via iCloud synchronisation of routes and points. If you have enabled this on your old device, enable it on your new device (Menu > More > Settings > Scroll to bottom). Then all routes and points should be retrieved automatically.

Alternatively, manual export all routes in the saved routes screen and save the file to a cloud storage like iCloud, One Drive or Google Drive.
Do the same with the points. Open the file on your new device with Topo GPS, or use Menu > More > Import file to import the file into Topo GPS.

Android -> Android
------------------
Purchases
~~~~~~~~~
The purchases will be automatically accessible if you use the same Google Play account as before. You might need to go to Menu > Maps > More maps to automatically retrieve the purchases.

Sometimes it can happen that you used a country specific Topo GPS app, like Topo GPS Netherlands or Topo GPS Sweden. That Topo GPS app has a different icon from the universal Topo GPS app. If you used a country specific Topo GPS app before, you need to install this country spefici app, otherwise you cannot retrieve your earlier purchase. Go to the Google Play store and search for 'Topo GPS Netherlands/Sweden etc.'. If you have installed the univeral app already, you could also go to Menu > Maps > More maps > More > Restore earlier purchases.
