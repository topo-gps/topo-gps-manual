=============

You can make the most important commands from Topo GPS anywhere accessible on your device by putting them on your Control Center, also called Control panel.

For this open the control panel making pull down movement from the top of your screen. Press long on the control panel to be able to modify it. Tap in the bottom on the option 'Add a control'. Then search for Topo GPS. 

A list of possible controls for Topo GPS will be shown. You can tap one of the controls and it will then be added to your control panel. You can then move the control to the desired position on the control panel and optionally enlarge or shrink it. You can repeat the procedure to add more Topo GPS controls.

The available controls for Topo GPS are:

- Route recorder, a toggle with with you can start or stop a route recording.
- Take photo, the camera in Topo GPS will be opened and if you take a photo it will be automatically added to a new waypoint and saved in your photo library.
- Save my location, a window will appear in which you can enter a title and description and save your current location as a waypoint.
- Search location
- Plan route, the route planner will be opened.
- Generate route, the route generator will be opened.
- Enter coordinates, you can directly enter coordinates.
- Scan coordinates, you can directly start scanning coordinates.
- Compass direction, you can directly enter a compass direction.

The great advantage of adding Topo GPS controls to your control panel is that you can now much quicker start recording a route for example. Just add the controls you need more often once. Then everytime you need to perform one of these commands, pull down the control center from anywhere on your device and tap the required command.
