Height extension
================

It is possible to extend Topo GPS with the height extension. This extension allows you to do the following:

- Show the terrain height (elevation) on the coordinates panel of the dashboard.
- Generate quick height profiles using the map ruler.
- Generate height profiles for routes planned with the transportation mode 'Crow fly'.
- Generate more accurate height profiles for all planned routes.
- Generate height profiles for routes that lack a height profile.
- Show height above ground and height above ground profiles.

The height extension is a paid extension and currently only available for The Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg and western and southern part of Germany. In the future we will add more regions. 

To purchase the height extension, zoom the map to one of the regions in which the height extension is available. Then slide the dashboard twice to the left to show the coordinates panel. Then tap on the coordinates panel and choose 'Show height'.
